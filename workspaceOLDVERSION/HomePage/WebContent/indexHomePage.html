	<!-- The paragraph will have breaks giving the illusion of a cleanly typed document -->
	<p>
		My name is Robert (Bobby) Spech and I am a student at Ohio State.<br></br> I am
		from Carmel, Indiana but I was originally born in Cleveland.<br></br>
		My favorite sport to play is Disc Golf and I am always down to go
		play.<br></br> I am actually trying to start up a Disc Golf Club here
		at Ohio State.<br></br> Let me know if you'd like to join!

	<h3>Here is a Photograph of Me:</h3>
	<!-- The Photograph will have a heading and an alt if it doesn't load properly -->

	<!-- The paragraph will have breaks giving the illusion of a cleanly typed document -->
	<p>
		This is a table with some of the Discs I throw when I play Frisbee
		Golf.<br></br> Speed is how fast one needs to throw the disc to
		perform up to its other numbers,<br></br> Glide is a measure of how
		"floaty" a disc is, Turn is a discs tendency to start going right,<br></br>
		and Fade is a discs tendency to finish its flight going to the left.
